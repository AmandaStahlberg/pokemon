## Introduction

In the assignment we were to create a webapp using Angular whose purpose was to function pokemon app where you can catch and store pokemons.
(TRY catch pikachu!)

Following software technologies are used.
`HTML |  TailwindCSS | Javascript | Typescript | Angular `

The project consists of 3 main parts as follows:

-   The Login page - an area where you can create a user and login
-   A pokemon page - an area where you can catch pokemons
-   Trainers Profile page - here you can se your stored pokemons and remove from the list

## Quick-setup to run the project

-   clone the repository
-   Open the project in Vscode
-   Open new terminal (not powershell)
-   if you havent insalled angular yet run: npm install -g @angular/cli
-   then run: npm install 
-   then run: ng serve
-   open up a new browser window and go to http://localhost:4200/

## If we had more time we would:

-   Test more for buggs and errors
-   Refactor code




This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
